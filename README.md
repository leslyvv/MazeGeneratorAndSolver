# MazeGeneratorAndSolver

<sub>Collaborated with two other students to create a maze generator and solver that implements algorithms from a Design and Analysis Algorithms course. The maze       generator was produced using a depth-first search algorithm and solved using a breadth-first search to find the shortest path.</sub>
